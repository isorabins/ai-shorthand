# Vercel Dev Hanging Issue - Research & Resolution Plan

## Problem Analysis
- **Issue**: `vercel dev` hangs after "Creating initial build" 
- **Warning**: `sh: yarn: command not found`
- **Environment**: npm-based project (package.json + package-lock.json)
- **Status**: Not linked to Vercel cloud (.vercel directory empty)

## Research Areas

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Project linking requirement for `vercel dev`
- [ ] Package manager detection conflicts (npm vs yarn)
- [ ] Build process hanging points
- [ ] Vercel.json configuration issues
- [ ] Environment variable access

### 2. Yarn Warning Impact
- [ ] When Vercel CLI tries to detect yarn
- [ ] How to force npm usage
- [ ] Package manager priority in Vercel

### 3. Project Linking Requirements  
- [ ] Whether `vercel link` is mandatory for local dev
- [ ] Alternatives to cloud linking for local development
- [ ] Manual project configuration options

### 4. Configuration Issues
- [ ] vercel.json routing problems for local dev
- [ ] Build command specification
- [ ] Environment variable loading

### 5. Common Solutions
- [ ] CLI flag overrides for package manager
- [ ] Manual project initialization steps
- [ ] Alternative local development approaches

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Troubleshooting
1. Test `vercel dev` with verbose logging
2. Try `vercel link` to connect project
3. Test alternative development approaches
4. Verify environment variable access

### Phase 2: Configuration Fixes
1. Update vercel.json if needed
2. Add package manager specification
3. Test build process components individually

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Document working solution
2. Create troubleshooting guide
3. Set up reliable dev workflow

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify why vercel dev hangs
- Resolve yarn detection issue  
- Establish working local development workflow
- Prevent future similar issues

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Does the project need cloud linking for local dev?
2. How to force npm usage over yarn detection?
3. What's the correct vercel.json setup for this architecture?
4. Are there missing initialization steps?
5. Can we run local dev without deploying first?
