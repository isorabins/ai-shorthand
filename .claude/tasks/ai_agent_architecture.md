# AI Agent Architecture Implementation Plan
## Token Compressor Project

### Overview
Design and implement a modular AI agent system for the Token Compressor project using vanilla JavaScript with React architectural patterns. This system will manage 3 collaborative AI agents in 30-second cycles with 10-turn conversations, following Claude agent best practices.

### Component Architecture Plan

#### 1. Base Agent Class (Abstract)
**File**: `/public/js/agents/base-agent.js`
- Abstract base class for all agents
- Provides common functionality: error handling, state management, logging
- Implements circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
- Manages conversation history and context
- Provides event emission/subscription system

#### 2. Discovery Agent
**File**: `/public/js/agents/discovery-agent.js`
- **Purpose**: Web search and token waste detection using DeepSeek
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Cycle through 15 search topics and 10 domains
  - Fetch random articles using Brave Search API
  - Analyze content with tiktoken for multi-token words
  - Identify token-wasteful patterns
  - Pass findings to Generation Agent
  - Update UI with real-time progress

#### 3. Generation Agent
**File**: `/public/js/agents/generation-agent.js`
- **Purpose**: Creative compression invention using Groq
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receive wasteful words from Discovery Agent
  - Generate creative compression symbols (no predefined palette)
  - Use 10 symbol options: ['~', '≈', '•', '◊', '∿', '†', '§', '¶', '♦', '★']
  - Ensure 1-token compressions through validation
  - Engage in 10-turn collaborative discussions

#### 4. Validation Agent
**File**: `/public/js/agents/validation-agent.js`
- **Purpose**: Reversibility testing using DeepSeek
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Test compressions for 100% reversibility
  - Use diverse test corpus for validation
  - Run during 55-60 minute "testing ceremony"
  - Update codex with only valid compressions
  - Trigger Twitter bot integration after ceremony

#### 5. Agent Orchestrator
**File**: `/public/js/orchestrator.js`
- **Purpose**: Coordinate all agent activities and manage cycles
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage 30-second discovery cycles (minutes 0-55)
  - Coordinate 10-turn conversations between agents
  - Trigger hourly testing ceremony (minutes 55-60)
  - Handle agent failures gracefully with fallbacks
  - Update UI with agent status and progress
  - Maintain global system state

#### 6. Supporting Utilities

**API Client** (`/public/js/utils/api-client.js`):
- Unified API client for all external services
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker implementation
- Request/response logging and monitoring
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

**Supabase Client** (`/public/js/utils/supabase-client.js`):
- Database operations for codex management
- Real-time subscriptions for UI updates
- Batch operations for testing ceremonies
- Data validation and sanitization

**Real-time UI** (`/public/js/ui/real-time-ui.js`):
- Live agent chat window updates
- Progress indicators and status displays
- Timeline updates for discoveries
- Leaderboard real-time synchronization

### Key Design Patterns

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Agents communicate through custom event system
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy to add new agents or modify existing ones
- Centralized event logging and debugging

#### 2. State Machine Pattern
- Each agent has clearly defined states (idle, working, waiting, error)
- Orchestrator manages global system state
- Predictable state transitions with validation
- Error recovery through state rollback

#### 3. Factory Pattern for Agent Creation
- Dynamic agent instantiation based on configuration
- Easy testing with mock agents
- Plugin-style architecture for extensibility
- Runtime agent swapping for A/B testing

#### 4. Observer Pattern for UI Updates
- Agents notify UI observers of state changes
- Multiple UI components can subscribe to same events
- Decoupled UI logic from business logic
- Efficient partial updates instead of full re-renders

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation Layer
1. Base Agent class with error handling
2. API Client with rate limiting and retries
3. Event system for inter-agent communication
4. Basic UI integration framework

#### Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation
1. Discovery Agent with web search integration
2. Generation Agent with compression creation logic
3. Basic agent-to-agent communication
4. Real-time UI updates

#### Phase 3: Validation & Orchestration
1. Validation Agent with testing ceremony logic
2. Agent Orchestrator with cycle management
3. Error recovery and fallback mechanisms
4. Complete UI integration

#### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
1. Performance optimization and monitoring
2. Enhanced error handling and logging
3. Production deployment preparation
4. Documentation and testing

### Technical Specifications

#### Agent Communication Protocol
```javascript
// Event structure for agent communication
const AgentMessage = {
  id: generateUUID(),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  source: 'discovery-agent',
  target: 'generation-agent',
  type: 'FINDINGS_READY',
  payload: {
    wastefulWords: [...],
    article: {...},
    confidence: 0.85
  }
};
```

#### State Management Structure
```javascript
// Global system state
const SystemState = {
  currentCycle: 1,
  phase: 'discovery', // 'discovery' | 'testing' | 'ceremony'
  agents: {
    discovery: { status: 'active', lastUpdate: timestamp },
    generation: { status: 'waiting', lastUpdate: timestamp },
    validation: { status: 'idle', lastUpdate: timestamp }
  },
  metrics: {
    cyclesCompleted: 0,
    compressionsFound: 0,
    validCompressions: 0,
    errorCount: 0
  }
};
```

#### Error Handling Strategy
- Circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Graceful degradation with offline fallbacks
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of agent modules
- Efficient DOM updates using DocumentFragment
- Request batching for API calls
- Memory management for long-running sessions
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

### Security & Reliability

#### Input Validation
- Sanitize all external API responses
- Validate compression formats before storage
- Prevent XSS through content security policies
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data storage in client-side code
- Anonymized user tracking for analytics
- Clear data retention policies
- GDPR compliance for user submissions

#### Resilience Patterns
- Agent health monitoring with automatic recovery
- Fallback mechanisms for each agent type
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting for production deployment

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Individual agent logic testing
- API client functionality testing
- Error handling scenario validation
- State management consistency checks

#### Integration Testing
- Agent-to-agent communication testing
- Database operation validation
- UI update synchronization testing
- End-to-end cycle completion testing

#### Performance Testing
- Load testing for concurrent agent operations
- Memory usage monitoring during long sessions
- API rate limiting validation
- UI responsiveness under high activity

### Success Metrics
- **Agent Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for each agent
- **Discovery Rate**: 10-20 valid compressions per day
- **System Performance**: <2 second response times
- **User Engagement**: Real-time UI updates within 100ms
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from 90%+ of failures

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Failures**: Circuit breakers and fallback data
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request spacing and queuing
- **Memory Leaks**: Regular cleanup and monitoring
- **Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement
- **Network Issues**: Offline mode with cached data

This architecture provides a robust, maintainable foundation for the Token Compressor AI agent system while following React component patterns and Claude agent best practices.
