# Token Compressor - Project Brief

## Core Vision
Token Compressor is a live AI evolution laboratory where AI agents collaborate to discover token-efficient compression patterns for AI-to-AI communication. The project has two phases:

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Discovery laboratory website where agents find compressions
**Phase 2 (Future)**: NPM/pip packages developers install to reduce AI API costs by 30-60%

## Key Requirements

### Three-Agent Collaboration System
- **Discovery Agent (DeepSeek)**: Web search + token waste detection
- **Generation Agent (Groq)**: Creative compression invention  
- **Validation Agent (DeepSeek)**: Reversibility testing

### Discovery Process Timeline
- **Minutes 0-55**: Continuous 30-second cycles with 10-turn agent conversations
- **Minutes 55-60**: Hourly "Testing Ceremony" - validation and codex updates

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend-only approach**: Static hosting with direct API calls through Vercel routes
- **Security-first**: API keys hidden server-side via Vercel API routes
- **Real-time updates**: Supabase for live data and subscriptions
- **GameBoy aesthetic**: VT323 font, retro earth-tone styling

### Integration Requirements
- **Brave Search**: User has account for real web search
- **tiktoken**: Accurate token counting (not character estimation)
- **Twitter bot**: Hourly tweets after testing ceremonies
- **Partial disclosure**: Protect AI discoveries, show human submissions

## Success Metrics
- 30-60% token reduction through discovered compressions
- 100% semantic accuracy (perfect reversibility)
- 10-20 valid compressions discovered per day
- Community engagement with human submissions

## Business Model
Phase 1 builds dataset through gamified discovery. Phase 2 monetizes via:
- Free tier: Top 100 compressions  
- Pro ($29/month): Full codex + updates
- Enterprise: Custom domain compressions

## Scope Boundaries
- Keep implementation simple (avoid scope creep)
- MVP-first approach with enhancement later
- Focus on core discovery mechanics
- No complex frameworks or over-engineering
