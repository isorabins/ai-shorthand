# Token Compressor - Current Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### Infrastructure & Architecture (100%)
- Vercel project structure with package.json and vercel.json
- Environment variables configuration (.env.example)
- Secure API proxy routes hiding all API keys server-side
- Comprehensive error handling with circuit breaker patterns
- Rate limiting and input validation across all routes

### Frontend Refactoring (100%) 
- Monolithic HTML split into modular structure
- GameBoy aesthetic preserved with CSS custom properties
- Component-based styling (gameboy-theme.css, components.css, animations.css)
- Mobile responsive design maintained
- Accessibility features and progressive enhancement

### API Integration (100%)
- `/api/search` - Brave Search proxy with fallback content
- `/api/deepseek` - DeepSeek Chat API for Discovery/Validation agents
- `/api/groq` - Groq API for Generation agent
- `/api/tokenize` - tiktoken integration for accurate token counting
- `/api/twitter` - Twitter bot for hourly discovery announcements

### AI Agent System (100%)
All agents rebuilt following Claude best practices:
- **Discovery Agent**: Web search + multi-token word detection
- **Generation Agent**: Creative compression invention with XML-structured prompts
- **Validation Agent**: Comprehensive reversibility testing
- Each agent includes extended thinking, detailed tool descriptions, error boundaries

### Utility Systems (100%)
- Configuration management with environment detection
- API client with retry logic and rate limiting
- Supabase client for real-time database operations
- Error handler with circuit breaker patterns

## üöß Currently In Progress

### Agent Orchestrator (50%)
- Need to build the conductor that coordinates 30-second cycles
- Manages 10-turn conversations between Discovery and Generation agents
- Triggers hourly testing ceremonies at minute 55

## ‚ùå Not Started

### Real-time UI Integration (0%)
- Connect agents to chat windows for live updates
- Form handlers for human submissions
- Live statistics and countdown timers
- Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Testing Ceremony Automation (0%)
- Hourly validation process automation
- Twitter bot integration after ceremonies
- Codex updates and leaderboard management

## Current State Assessment

### What Works
- Complete backend API infrastructure
- Secure authentication and rate limiting
- All three AI agents with sophisticated prompting
- Modular frontend structure ready for integration

### What's Missing
- Orchestration layer to coordinate agent interactions
- Live UI updates and real-time functionality
- Automated testing ceremonies every hour
- Connection between backend and frontend

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Build Agent Orchestrator with 30-second discovery cycles
2. Create real-time UI system with Supabase subscriptions  
3. Implement automated testing ceremony workflow
4. Connect forms and statistics to live data

### Estimated Time to Completion
- Agent Orchestrator: ~20 minutes
- Real-time UI: ~25 minutes  
- Testing automation: ~15 minutes
- Integration testing: ~10 minutes

**Total remaining: ~70 minutes to fully functional discovery lab**

## Technical Notes
- Following Claude agent best practices throughout
- XML-structured prompts for reliable AI interactions
- Token-efficient design patterns
- Security-first architecture with proper input validation
- Performance optimized with rate limiting and error recovery
