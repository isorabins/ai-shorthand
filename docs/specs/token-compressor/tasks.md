## Implementation Dependencies and Sequencing

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Infrastructure Domain (1.1-1.4) must complete before Backend Domain begins
2. Database Domain (2.1-2.4) must complete before agent implementation (3.3-3.5)
3. Backend API routes (3.1-3.2) must be ready before Frontend integration (4.7)
4. Agent orchestration (3.6) requires all three agents (3.3-3.5) to be complete

**Parallel Execution Opportunities:**
- Frontend components (4.1-4.6) can develop in parallel with Backend agents (3.3-3.5)
- Database optimization (2.3) can proceed alongside API development (3.1-3.2)
- Testing framework setup (5.1-5.2) can begin early and run continuously
- Security implementation (1.2, 5.2) should run in parallel with all domains

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive mocking for external API dependencies
- Create fallback mechanisms for all critical system components
- Use feature flags to enable gradual rollout of agent functionality
- Maintain detailed error logging for production debugging support

This implementation plan provides a structured, domain-based approach to delivering the Token Compressor while enabling parallel development and minimizing integration risks.
